# Learning
In 14 days of learning Java what have I learnt? not much.

My process:

1. Tediously going through "Java Programming Masterclass updated to Java 17" which I think goes into too much detail, being impatient I sometimes increase the speed to 1.25x. Trying to be frugal about which key notes to take down, but still ending up with 6 pages of information I don't know or that I should solidify from Section 1 through to 4.
2. Got carried away with the Recap class, wasted many hours trying to write a program, without planning, without understanding, well above my skill level, copying and pasting code, and hacking. What did I learn? It's not worth the headache or the time.
3. I have a document 6 pages long from the course that I haven't reviewed yet. I'm now 1.5 pages in, transfering notes and applying it in IntelliJ. I feel this could be another waste of time, copying from the course to a doc; copying from a doc to a program.
4. I just want to start writing programs, maybe that's just me procrastining, wanting to avoid all the documentation, tedious video watching, note taking, memorisation, and wanting the thrill of solving problems ... Maybe that thrill is what will drive me to learn.
5. For now I think it's a good idea to start writing programs, work my way up in difficulty, attempting to apply what I've learnt; let's see what happens.
